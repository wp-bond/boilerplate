All translations are automatically handled by Google Translate or AWS Translate.

They will be saved here and you can take over and adjust.

As most texts in development code are single words or short phrases these translators are not able to guess correctly the subject or context. Anyway, it's a great head start, just open these translations and correct what is needed.

At any time, you can delete these translations entirelly and start fresh.
